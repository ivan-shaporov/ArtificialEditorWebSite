      Dear Mr. Doe,

      I hope this email finds you well. I seem to have misplaced your invoice and I was wondering if you could send it to me again. As I am unable to locate it, I am unable to process payment at this time.

      I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

      Sincerely,
      Jack
